# Insight-Data-Challenge

Hello, we are OncoMatch. Our company has developed a software system that helps doctors schedule appointments with patients. We have been asked to build a new feature to help identify patients that are mostly likely to no-show for appointments. With help from our clients (doctor's offices), we have collected data from 110,527 medical appointments, the schema of which is placed below.
